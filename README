= Sheep Cron

== DESCRIPTION:

Sheep Cron, to be confused with "Cheap Cron", is a poor man's cron. It's a pure Ruby alternative for:
* Times when cron is not available
* People that hates the cron syntax
* Fun and profit

== USAGE:

Scheduling jobs:

SheepCron.do |job|
	job.schedule :every => 1.day, :at => '12:00'
	job.run 'Sheep.graze'
end

# a little more complete job featuring name and exceptions
SheepCron.do |job|
	job.name 'Work'
	job.schedule :every => 1.day, :at => '9am', :except => { |t| t.saturday? || t.sunday? }
	job.run 'Sheep.work'
end

# jobs can have multiple schedules too
SheepCron.do |job|
	job.schedule :every => 1.week, :at => 'friday, 9pm'
	job.schedule :every => 1.year, :at => '25/12'
	job.run 'Sheep.party!'
end

== CONFIGURATION:

SheepCron.configure do |jobs|
	jobs.launcher = :rails    # will run jobs via script/runner
	jobs.launcher = :custom, :includes => ['activerecord', 'app/sheep.rb']
	jobs.timeout 60.seconds
end

== INSTALL:

gem install sheep_cron

== I CAN HAS PATCHES?:

* Cron "bridge": accept a crontab to define schedules
* More job storage backends
